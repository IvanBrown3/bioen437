        "1. (5 pts) Create an Antimony model that consists of a linear chain of 5 species. The reaction rate for $S_k \\rightarrow S_{k+1}$ is $\\frac{S_k}{k}$ for $1 \\leq k \\leq5$. There are two boundary reactions: (i) $S_1$ is synthesized at the rate 1 and (ii) $S_5$ is degraded at a rate $1/5$.  Run the model. Plot the time course of the 5 species. Choose the simulation duration and number of points so that the relationships between species concentrations is clearly displayed.\n",
        "1. (5 pts) Construct a figure with 10 scatter plots organized as follows.\n",
        "    1. For each plot, the x-value is $S_k$ at time $t$ and the y-value is $S_{k+1}$ at time $t$.\n",
        "    1. The columns are $S_k$, for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4}$. The rows are $k \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. This means that the resulting figure is a half square or triangle. (Look at matplotlib.gridspec.)\n",
        "    1. Explain the shape of the curves when the $x$ and $y$ variables differ. Specifically, explain why the $y$ value is zero for an extended period before it increases abruptly. Use the time series plots in Q1 in your explanation.\n",
        "1. (5 pts) This is a search problem. For the reaction network in (1), add the degradation reaction $S_2 \\rightarrow âˆ…$ at a rate $S_2$. Also, add the synthesis reaction $\\rightarrow S_4$ at the rate $kk$. Find the value of $kk$ such that the steady state value of $S_5$ in this network is the same as its value in the original network. Plot the time course of the network with the value of $kk$ that you found.\n"
